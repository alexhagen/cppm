    "The ``ah_value`` class is a simple, encapsulated c++ class to help track values.  It is written with the signal-slot paradigm so that events can be triggered as the values change.  This is a way to decrease the overhead that must happen to trace some values (such as checking if something is over a certain value every loop).\n",

This class holds the value object, and also the notifier (duh) method, that will ring back and tell us when the alarm goes off."
